# Xingyuming Liu (刘星宇明)

I am a second-year Ph.D. student at School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, advised by [Prof. Chenren Xu](https://soar.group/chenren/). My research focuses on developing innovative wireless AI systems tailored for medical applications, with an emphasis on advancing biological experiments and improving human health outcomes. In addition, I maintain a broad interest in self-supervised learning, embodied intelligence, and multimodal perception.
