# Xingyuming Liu (刘星宇明)

I am a second-year Ph.D. student at School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, advised by [Prof. Chenren Xu](https://soar.group/chenren/).
My research focuses on developing intelligent systems with multi-modal sensing and machine learning techniques.

# News

- 11/2025: 🚶 Start MSRA internship in Beijing. Explore the intersection of wireless sensing and embodied AI.

- 11/2025: 📑 Our paper *mTrack* has been accepted by SenSys 2026! We propose a novel RFID-vision hybrid tracking system for long-term mouse social behavior analysis.
